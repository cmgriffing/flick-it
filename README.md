## Issues and Feature Requests

Feel free to create an Issue on this repo for any bugs or feature requests you have.

## Contributing

Contributing is easy. To get started clone the repo.

It is helpful to maintain two separate terminals for each, the configuration app and the game.

Then install the app's dependencies.

## make sure you're in the root directory

<!-- we do run-p because sometimes run-s fails on windows -->

```
run-s cinstall pinstall 
```

In each terminal, run:

```
yarn dev
```
